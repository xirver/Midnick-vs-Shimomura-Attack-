Mitnick vs Shimomura Attack

This project is the second Assignment for the Computer Network Security (CNS) course made by VuSec. 
The goal of this project was to recreate the Mitnick vs Shimomura attack, on a simulated environment.
Starting by executing a TCP SYN flooding towards a service on server, which requires to impersonate
a non-existing host. Moving to IP Spoofing with blind connection establishment. Finally injecting a
backdoor on x-terminal pretending to be server resulting on a free access to the server without the
needs of inserting any password, in order to retrive the secret message left by Shimomura on his 
system (saved into secret.txt).
